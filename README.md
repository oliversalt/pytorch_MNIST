# pytorch_MNIST
This is where I train and test a model using pytorch with the MNIST dataset

I managed to get a 98% accuracy on the 20% of the data which was testing data after training the model. This time i used Adam to train instead of SGD. The convolution file does the training and saves the network. 

After testing the network with my own drawn numbers I managed to get an accuracy of 66%. This isn't super reliable as a performance indicator as the pencil radius and how the image is drawn isn't the same as the original MNIST data.
